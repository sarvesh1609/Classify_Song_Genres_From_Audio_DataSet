# Classify_Song_Genres_From_Audio_DataSet
The goal is to classify songs as either Rock or Hip-Hop using audio data without the need for actual listening. The steps involved in achieving this include data cleaning, exploratory data visualization, feature reduction through correlation and PCA, and the application of machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and logistic regression. 

There are two main data files: 'fma-rock-vs-hiphop.csv' and 'echonest-metrics.csv'. The first file contains general song information, including titles and a crucial 'genre_top' column indicating if the song is Rock or Hip-Hop. The second file has details like danceability, acousticness, valence, and more, making up eight features in total.

This project is done in both Python and R. If you're friendly with R then use the R script or if you're friendly with Python the use Python script. The repository includes scripts for both languages, each with clear explanations of the code and its steps. You can understand the logic behind each line of code easily.

To try it yourself, start by downloading and loading the datasets. Then, run the Python or R script in your chosen environment. This will help you classify songs into Rock or Hip-Hop based on their audio characteristics.
